# StoneRUN-v0.1
This is the first version of my new Unity project!
Welcome to the thrilling world of "StoneRUN" my new Unity project, a captivating Unity game that combines classic gameplay mechanics with a unique twist. Get ready to navigate through a dynamic environment as a rock character, collecting resources, and aiming for the highest score!

In this exciting game, you'll take control of a lively and adventurous rock character, maneuvering it across a grid-based terrain reminiscent of the classic snake game. However, instead of a traditional snake, you control a spirited rock that grows longer as it collects precious apples scattered throughout the terrain.

Your mission is to guide the rock character around and not hitting yourself. As you progress, the stakes rise, and the game's difficulty increases, testing your reflexes and strategic thinking. Each successful collection of apples not only increases your score but also elongates your rock character, making the challenge even more exhilarating.

This is the first version of the game and in the next update, there will be a main menu and many more interesting changes that will make the game much more fun to play! :)
